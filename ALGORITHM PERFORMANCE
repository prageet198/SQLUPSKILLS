//IN THIS QUESTION I HAVE USED THE SUB QUERY APPROACH. WE CAN DO THE SAME THING USING CTE AS WELL

SELECT A.search_id, MAX(A.Rating) FROM (select search_id,
CASE
WHEN clicked=0 THEN '1'
WHEN clicked=1 AND search_results_position>3 THEN '2'
ELSE '3' END AS Rating
from fb_search_events) AS A
GROUP BY A.search_id
